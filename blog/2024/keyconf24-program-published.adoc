KeyConf24, our 2024 Keycloak Identity Summit, will happen on September 19th, which is just around the corner! This year's event promises to be even bigger and better, with a program packed
full of relevant, cutting-edge topics.

This year due to high demand and limited space on-site, we're offering for the first time a live stream, so the Keycloak community can join remotely.

* *European Digital Identity Wallet:* Deep dives into the European Union's ambitious initiative and its impact on identity management.

* *Verifiable Credentials:* Explore the exciting potential of decentralized identity verification and the role of Keycloak.

* *Real-world Keycloak integrations:* Technical sessions on Keycloakâ€™s capabilities and how to leverage them in real world scenarios like the banking industry.
